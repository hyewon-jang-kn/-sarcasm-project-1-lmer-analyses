lmer analyses from sarcasm project 1

[descriptions]

This repository contains code for lmer analysis conducted on sarcasm data collected via experiments with human participants. 
In the first experiment, participants (N = 60) responded freely to 32 stimuli and rated their own responses in terms of their sarcasm levels. 
In the second experiment, new participants (N = 360; nested design) rated the responses by the previous participants in terms of their sarcasm levels.
